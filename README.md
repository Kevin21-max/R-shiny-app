Time Series Analysis Tool
Our Shiny app is designed to make time series analysis accessible and interactive. Whether you're a researcher, student, or data analyst, this app provides an intuitive way to explore and model time-dependent data. Users can upload their own datasets and apply key statistical techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and seasonal variations.

Key Features & Functionalities:
• File Upload – Users can upload CSV or Excel files containing time series data.
• Variable Selection – Dynamically choose the column representing the time series variable for analysis.
• Frequency Setting – Set the frequency (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly) to ensure correct time series modeling.
• Data Visualization – Automatically generates plots to visualize trends and patterns in the time series data.
• ACF & PACF Analysis – Displays Auto-correlation (ACF) and Partial Auto-correlation (PACF) plots to assess relationships between time lags.
• SARIMA Modeling – Fits Seasonal ARIMA models, helping users forecast future trends and evaluate residuals.
• Smoothing Techniques – Implements Moving Average smoothing to reduce noise and highlight long-term trends.

With its user-friendly interface and real-time interactivity, this app makes complex time series analysis simpler and more efficient. Built using R and Shiny, it runs seamlessly in web browsers without requiring additional software installation
